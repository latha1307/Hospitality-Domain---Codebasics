# Hospitality-Domain---Codebasics
Here, I've done a project (title: Hospitality Domain), with the help of codebasics YouTube channel. This help me to experience a real time hands on data analysis project. Thank you! Mr. Dhaval Patel

#Problem statement:
Domain:  Hospitality       Function: Revenue
        AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

#Task:  

     You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

      1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
      2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
      3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

My Dashboard:
        Given in issues(use Power BI desktop).

#Conclusion:
       1. This dashboard helps the stakeholder to make better decisions. 
       2. Since, the ADR is constant[from the dashboard] shows that the hotel has major problem on fixed pricing. Solution for this problem is the hotel can use either dynamic pricing or weekday weekend pricing, probably this may help the organization  to get more revenue.
       3. To increase the occupancy% of the hotels, they should increase their average rating by providing a better atmosphere and good customer service to their customers.
       4. The hotels should implement essential pricing, discount coupons and increase promotions on their own website, in order to help the major issue i.e. Fixed pricing.
